How do you create a project that works with Lazy Programmers source code?

Unix:

Copy the basicSSDLProject folder in the newWork subfolder, and rename it appropriately.  
To make, type make.
To run, type ./runx

Microsoft Visual Studio:

Either

Copy the basicSSDLProject in the newWork subfolder, and rename it appropriately. Be sure to
keep it in this newWork folder so the relative paths to the include and library directories still work.

or

See Appendix A of _C++26 for Lazy Programmers_ to make  your own.
